Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.\n# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. \n# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set\n# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. \n# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of \n#    each variable for each activity and each subject.\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(dplyr);\nlibrary(tidyr);\n\nrun_analysis <- function()\n{\n        ## data files\n        test_subject_file <- \"./test/subject_test.txt\"    # the subject involved in the observation (1-30)\n        y_test_file <- \"./test/y_test.txt\"                # the activity he was involved in (1-6)\n        x_test_file <- \"./test/x_test.txt\"                # the measurements of the activity (561 feature points)\n        train_subject_file <- \"./train/subject_train.txt\"\n        y_train_file <- \"./train/y_train.txt\"\n        x_train_file <- \"./train/x_train.txt\"\n        features_file <- \"features.txt\"                   # the features file describing the variables of measurements\n        activity_labels_file <- \"activity_labels.txt\"     # the description of the activitoes (1-6)\n        \n        ###\n        ###  Step 0:  Read the data files\n        ###\n        print(\">>> Reading Data Files...\")\n        \n        ##  read the test data set (30%)\n        if (file.exists(test_subject_file))\n                subject_test <- read.table(test_subject_file)\n        \n        if (file.exists(y_test_file))  ## test labels\n                y_test <- read.table(y_test_file)\n        \n        if (file.exists(x_test_file))  ## test data\n                x_test <- read.table(x_test_file)\n        \n        ##  read the train data set (70%)\n        if (file.exists(train_subject_file))\n                subject_train <- read.table(train_subject_file) \n\n        if (file.exists(y_train_file))  ## train labels\n                y_train <- read.table(y_train_file)\n\n        if (file.exists(x_train_file))  ## train data set with 561 features\n                x_train <- read.table(x_train_file)\n\n        # read the features file\n        if(file.exists(features_file)) features_df <- read.table(features_file)\n        # read the activity labels file\n        if (file.exists(activity_labels_file)) activity_labels <- read.table(activity_labels_file)\n\n        colnames(x_test) <- features_df$V2      # name the columns\n        colnames(x_train) <- features_df$V2     # name the columns\n\n        ###\n        ### Step 1:  MERGE the data sets\n        ###\n        print(\">>> Merging Data Sets...\")\n        \n        ## merge the test data sets\n        test_df <- cbind(subject_test, y_test, x_test)\n        ## merge the train data sets\n        train_df <- cbind(subject_train, y_train, x_train)\n        ## merge test and train data sets together\n        full_df <- rbind(test_df, train_df)\n        \n        ## rename the columns\n        colnames(full_df)[1] <- \"subject\"\n        colnames(full_df)[2] <- \"activity\"\n        \n        ###\n        ### Step 2:  Extract only mean and std dev measurements for each measurement\n        ###\n        print(\">>> Extracting mean() and std() columns...\")\n\n        expr <- \"[Mm]ean|std[()]|subject|activity\"\n        # extract only the columns that has 'mean()' and 'std()'\n        # subset the dataset with the required cols\n        full_df <- full_df[, grep(expr, colnames(full_df), value=TRUE) ]\n\n        ###\n        ### Step 3:  Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set\n        ###\n        print(\">>> Adding descriptive activity names...\")\n        full_df$activity <- factor(full_df$activity, labels=activity_labels$V2)\n        \n        ###\n        ### Step 4: Label dataset with descriptive variable names\n        ###\n        ##  use gsub() to replace short forms to longer forms\n        #gsub(names(full_df), \"^t\", \"Time \")\n        \n\n        ###\n        ### Step 5: Tidy data - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy \n        ###         data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\n        ###\n        #  use ddply() if using \"plyr\" package\n        #  use group_by() and summarize() if using \"dplyr\" package\n \n        #final_df <- ddply(full_df, .(activity, subject), numcolwise(mean))\n         \n        #final_df %>%\n        #        group_by(activity, subject) %>%\n        #        summarize_each()\n        \n        return(full_df)\n        #write.table(final_df,file=\"output.txt\", row.names=FALSE)\n}",
